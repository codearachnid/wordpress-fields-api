# How To Rollout Core Fields API

A successful launch of the Core Fields API will need to consider its impact in three different scenarios:
* Existing Core
* Existing Plugins
* New Development

Like all classic software development, it will be critical to identify an appropriate MVP to offset the investment with a meaningful impact.  Our original scope is proposed to include addressing the following:
## Existing Core
  * {Elements}
## Existing Plugins
  * {Elements}
## New Development
  All subsequent development should integrate with the Fields API via these specifications {insert link}.

The baseline impact of this addressing this critical mass will justify the effort for - and initial launch of - this pursuit.  Subsequent to its first release, we will continue working through the remaining backlog of core elements and plugins at that point in time as well as any additional elements introduced based on {insert prioritization method/details}.
